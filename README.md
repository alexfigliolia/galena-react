# Galena

The Galena allows you to treat your performance marks and measures as subscribable events!

By creating subscriptions to your performance markers, you can take fine-grained control over task execution and adjust routines at runtime for users experiencing fast or slow performance.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -S galena
# or
yarn add galena
# or
bolt add galena
```
